In event-driven architecture, microservices do not need to actively subscribe to external messages, but can instead centralize all entries that trigger changes in the microservice system to the API, and only need to focus on the current microservice\'s own business domain model definition and design of the API, without having to adapt and parse external service messages through a lot of glue code. EventBridge is responsible for safely and reliably adapting and delivering external service-generated events to the API designed by the current microservice.","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"eventbridge/03RocketMQEventBridgeQuickStart":{"id":"eventbridge/03RocketMQEventBridgeQuickStart","title":"RocketMQ EventBridge Quick Start","description":"RocketMQ EventBridge requires a message service to store events and a runtime to subscribe and push events.
